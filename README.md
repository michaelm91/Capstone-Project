# Montgomery County Traffic Incidents
This is the repo for my Data Science Capstone Project at Montgomery College. In this project, I explored data from Maryland's Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS), available on dataMontgomery, Montgomery County's open data platform. The system produces three datasets, [incidents](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crash-Reporting-Incidents-Data/bhju-22kf), [drivers](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crash-Reporting-Drivers-Data/mmzv-x632), and [non-motorists](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crash-Reporting-Non-Motorists-Data/n7fk-dce5), which form a record of each crash in the county since 2015.
